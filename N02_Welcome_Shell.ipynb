    "# Command Line and the Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "Command line interface (CLI) and graphic user interface (GUI) are two different ways of interacting with a computer’s operating system. The **shell** is a program that presents a CLI which allows you to control your computer using commands entered with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "A shell allows simple interactive computer programming sessions that follow the REPL paradigm. In REPL, which stands for *read-eval-print loop*, the computer displays a prompt that is ready to take user's text input, waits for CR (`Return`) that indicates that the user finish the input, executes it, and returns the result as text as well, many times right after user's text, prints the prompt and awaits for the next input.\n",
    "\n",
    "A program written in a REPL environment is executed in a piecewise, sequential manner: the computer does not start working on a command before it finishes the previous one. REPL's facilitate exploratory programming and debugging because the programmer can inspect the printed intermediary results before deciding what expression to provide for the next read.\n",
    "\n",
    "The text that is typed by the user in a shell is made of short words that have simple meaning and are limited to well defined operations. By combining simple commands, your work can be done more efficiently and more quickly, than by using graphical interfaces that can present only a limited number of options and possibilities in menus and buttons that are cliked with the mouse. When you need to do things tens to hundreds of times, knowing how to use the shell is transformative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because is simple text that can be typed with a keyboard, CLI interaction is effective across different OS's and environments, allowing the use of remote computers or cloud computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons to learn about the shell. For example, when you have to repeat a procedure it is might be hard and boring to remember the correct and precise succession of clicks and menu choices. Instead you can record the actions in  shell script, and repeat it a thousand times with no mistakes. The shell makes your work more reproducible, and allows you to keep clean logs and records of your work."

    "## How to access the shell?\n",
    "\n",
    "On a Mac or Linux machine, you can access a shell through a program named `Terminal`, which is already available on your computer. In Windows, the situation is a little bit more complicated; the original shell has been a part since the MS-DOS era, even before Windows GUI, with a limited and slightly different set of commands. Open the search box and type the command `cmd` to run this shell. A `Powershell` program was later introduced to address the deficiencies of MS-DOS command shell. The newest versions of Windows 10, has yet another shell called WLS (Windows Subsystem for Linux) that behaves almost identical with a Linux one.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access a shell right from a Jupyter session from `File > New > Terminal`. You should see the prompt showing the current user and machine followed by &#36; and a blinking cursor indicating the shell is ready to accept text from you. The server that hosts *Jupyterhub* runs Linux and the specific shell that is available is called `bash` (Bourne Again Shell), a member of a large family of variants: ksh, csh, zsh, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see something simple. Open a terminal and type `date`\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "(base) [vrinceanu@node-1 ~]$ date\n",
    "Wed Jan 27 23:58:03 CST 2021\n",
    "(base) [vrinceanu@node-1 ~]$\n",
    "```\n",
    "Obviously, the command `date` here prints the current date and time and gives you another prompt, right after finishing printing the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shells have a number of registries, or variables, that can be modified to allow various behaviors. For example, if you want to change the text of the prompt, you need to work with the environmental variable `PS1`. Type echo to see what is the current value, and change it to a simple \\$ followed by space, and press `ENTER`\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "(base) [vrinceanu@node-1 ~]$ echo $PS1\n",
    "(base) [\\u@\\h \\W]$\n",
    "(base) [vrinceanu@node-1 ~]\\$ PS1='$ '\n",
    "$ \n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that the you need to use \\$ before the name of the variable to obtain its value, otherwise the `echo` command would print just the word `PS1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you in an existential crisis? Try the command `whoami`\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ whoami\n",
    "vrinceanu\n",
    "```\n",
    "There is a command for everything. The command `hostname` will tell you the name of the machine that takes your commands.  The command `cal` will print a calendar. Are you in mood for a fortune cookie? Type `fortune`. Try it! If you are still not convinced about the power of the shell, type this: `[ where is my brain?`"

    "## The Filesystem\n",
    "\n",
    "Data files, logs, libraries, manuals, binaries, are all stored in a hard drive. A modern computer has hundreds of thousand, and maybe millions of individual files. Bash, by design, is very efficient in understanding and facilitating operations with the filesystem in the computer. \n",

    "\n",
    "In Linux (as well as in a Mac, or even Windows) files are organized in a tree structure with branches, called directories (or folders), and leafs that are the actual files. The very top of the filesystem directory tree is called the **root directory** and is symbolized by \"/\". To arrive at a leaf, one needs to give a recipe of traversing the tree branch-by-branch starting from the root. Each directory name is followed by the character \"/\" to form the *path* to a file. Note that this is different from the backslash \"\\\\\", used in Windows to separate folder names.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the executable file for `bash` itself is locate here:\n",
    "```shell\n",

By defaults, you have allocated a portion of the filesystem for your own use, which is a sub-tree that starts from your home directory.\n",

    "\n",
    "Some files are binary and can be executed. They can be native commands that came with the OS, created and compiled by other programmers, or created by you.  When typing a command, the shell first looks for an executable within the current directory. If it can not find it there, then it looks in set of special directories that are stored in the environmental variable `PATH`. Type `echo $PATH` to see what is available. There maybe useful commands stored in other directories, if those directories are not listed in `$PATH$`, then the only way to run those programs is to navigate with `cd` to these places. The other option would be to augment the `PATH` variable with the new path\n",

    "\n",
    "If type just `cd`, the shell will put you directly into your home directory no matter where you are in the filesystem. You change the directory by using a relative path like in `cd new_directory` or an absolute path by starting from the root `cd /home/vrinceanu/new_directory`. There is yet another way to get to your files by using the special symbol `~` which represents your home directory. So will obtain the same result with `cd ~\\new_directory`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A stubborn program can be stopped with `Ctr-C`, or, many times can be exited with `Ctr-D`. You can copy a file with `cp`, move (or rename) it  with 'mv`, delete (remove) it with 'rm'. Here I remove a whole directory, all files and directories within\n",

    "```shell\n",
