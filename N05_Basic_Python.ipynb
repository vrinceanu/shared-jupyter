    "Here is a short Python tutorial meant to set you quickly on the path of doing Computational Physics right away, and eventually learning some more Python as you go along. This is not supposed to be comprehensive, but instead is intended to introduce you to the main concepts that are most important for our tasks. If you have never used Python before, you would want to supplement this with some sort of beginner tutorial. If you have already got acquainted with Python, this will refresh your knowledge and help you understand how exactly is Python is used for solving physics problems.\n",

    "There is no computer language specific to Computational Physics. Researcher have used a variety of programming tools as a mean toward achieving a goal. The computer science aspect was never the focus, and many times a language has been adopted just because was new, full of promise, and maybe because physicists are driven by the desire to explore and experiment. Programming in Computational Physics has been done in Pascal, Basic, C, C++ and Java, each coming with a set of advantages and disadvantages. It might be no coincidence that the first programming language was invented exactly for helping us to tell computers how to solve physics and math problem. The name of this language is FORTRAN, it means literally **FOR**mula **TRAN**slation, and has been in use since 1960's because is quite fast and direct. We don't know yet if Python's popularity will fade away some day, but the skills and concepts on which it is build are quite universal across programming languages, and your time and effort invested in learning it will not be wasted, even if a new programming language will pop up some day.\n",

    "## What Python is?\n",
    "Python, like the shell, is an interpreted high level REPL that can be used to automatize, facilitate and make easy everything that a computer can do from art or engineering, to surf the web (without a browser), calculate your taxes, write poetry, make a movie or do math. Python has gained popularity because it has been widely adopted by Data Scientists and researchers in Machine Learning. As a result, Python and all associated tools are very well documented, with tutorials and complete manuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is easy to learn, simple to use, and enormously powerful. Python runs on an amazing range of hardware, from weeny underpowered Arduino's and stamp size microcontrollers, to world fastest supercomputers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, two main version of Python are in circulation: Python 2.X and Python 3.X, with X the subversion number. These version have significant difference, and an old Python 2 code will most likely not run as you would expect on more recent version of Python 3, but the differences are minor and can be fixed with some effort. Python 2 is not supported, anymore and no serious programs are written using it. It is recommended that all new pieces of Python to be written using Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a procedural language, meaning that most results can be obtained by applying functions, eventually chained one after another, to the input. Object oriented programming style is also possible. In fact, almost everything in Python is an object that encapsulate attributes and methods, and supports inheritance and polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Python is not?\n",
    "The Python language has a small minimal set of keywords and does not place many strict restrictions on the data types in a program and it has very relaxed rules with respect to memory allocation and management. As a result, Python programs are clean and easy to understand. They almost read like English. This flexibility comes with a price, however. Python itself is not particularly fast and it can not run concurrently on multicore CPU's. The solution for this problem is to used Python as a glue language. Python has powerful and easy to use facilities to integrate binary code written in other language for efficiency. For example, instead of using native Python sluggish mathematical facilities, one can use the `numpy` library that has vector operations written explicitly as pieces of Fortran and C code, and offered to the user as Python functions. The code below multiplies two one million dimensional vectors using native Python instruction and `numpy` specialized code. Don't worry if you don't understand all the commands here, although everything is pretty intuitive. The important thing is that `numpy` is more than 100 times faster."

If you want to represent a quantity of energy in your program, that variable should be called `energy`. Naming it just `e` might be confusing: would that be the number 'e', the base of natural logarithm?\n",
